# Muscovite Sun
 Using Openstreetmap to find best sunrise/sunset observation streets in Moscow. Kind of a piece of art rather than useful tool, actually :)

 ## Project description
 The aim of this project was to compile a Moscow map representing whether a street is appropriate for sunrise (or sunset) observation or not. The final result is based on street azimuths that which are being compared to monthly solar data.

 ## Future plans
 - Improve visualization of street grades (hypothesis: bigger grade implies better/clearer sun observation);
 - Launch a [Flask] website compiling the map for a given date.
